## [Unreleased] — Structured Plan Engine

### Added

#### Structured Plan Engine (`@reactive-agents/reasoning` + `@reactive-agents/memory` + `@reactive-agents/llm-provider`)

Complete rewrite of the plan-execute-reflect strategy with structured JSON plans, replacing fragile text-parsed numbered lists:

- **`packages/reasoning/src/types/plan.ts`** — `Plan`, `PlanStep`, `LLMPlanOutput` type-safe schemas. `hydratePlan()` generates deterministic short IDs (`s1`, `s2`). `resolveStepReferences()` for `{{from_step:sN}}` interpolation.
- **`packages/reasoning/src/structured-output/`** — Reusable 4-layer structured output pipeline: high-signal prompting → JSON repair → Schema validation → retry with error feedback. `extractJsonBlock()` and `repairJson()` handle markdown fences, trailing commas, single quotes, truncated JSON.
- **`packages/llm-provider`** — `StructuredOutputCapabilities` interface. Each provider reports JSON mode, schema enforcement, prefill, and grammar support.
- **`packages/memory`** — `plans` + `plan_steps` SQLite tables. `PlanStoreService` for persistent plan CRUD.
- **`packages/reasoning/src/strategies/plan-execute.ts`** — Rewritten with structured JSON plans, hybrid step execution (tool_call direct dispatch, analysis/composite scoped kernel), graduated retry → patch → replan, plan persistence.
- **`packages/reasoning/src/strategies/shared/plan-prompts.ts`** — Tier-adaptive prompt builders: plan generation, patch, step execution, reflection.
- **`PlanExecuteConfig`** — Extended with `planMode` ("linear" | "dag"), `stepRetries`, `patchStrategy`.

### Fixed

#### Plan Persistence & Error Handling (`@reactive-agents/reasoning` + `@reactive-agents/memory`)

- **`PlanStoreServiceLive` wired into memory layer** — Was missing from `createMemoryLayer()` in `packages/memory/src/runtime.ts`, so `Effect.serviceOption` always returned `None` and plans were never persisted despite the tables existing
- **Step status updates use correct ID** — `updateStepStatus()` was called with composite `${planId}_${stepId}` but DB primary key is just `stepId`
- **Effect error handling** — Replaced broken `try/catch` (doesn't catch Effect typed errors in generators) with `Effect.exit()` + `Exit.isSuccess()` + `Cause.squash()` pattern for reliable retry loop
- **Goal stored as plain text** — `extractGoalText()` unwraps JSON-wrapped `{"question":"..."}` from execution engine's `JSON.stringify(task.input)`
- **"FINAL ANSWER:" stripped from step outputs** — `stripFinalAnswerPrefix()` prevents ReAct protocol artifacts from leaking into tool args via `{{from_step:sN}}` references
- **Analysis steps use direct `llm.complete()`** — Removed unnecessary ReAct kernel overhead for pure reasoning steps (no tools needed)
- **Tool signatures show required vs optional** — `name` vs `name?` in plan generation prompt helps LLM include all required parameters
- **Planning rules enforce efficiency** — Min steps, prefer tool_call, max ONE analysis step, combine related work

#### Duplicate Step Prevention (`@reactive-agents/reasoning`)

- **All-steps-completed guard** — If every plan step completed successfully, treat as satisfied regardless of LLM reflection text. Prevents false-negative refinement loops that re-execute side-effecting actions (e.g., sending duplicate messages)
- **Carry-forward refinement** — Plan generation moved outside refinement loop. Completed steps preserved across cycles — only failed/pending steps get patched and re-executed via `buildPatchPrompt`
- **`isSatisfied()` case-insensitive** — Now matches `"Satisfied:"`, `"Status: Satisfied"`, etc. Reflection prompt restructured to force `SATISFIED:` or `UNSATISFIED:` as first word
- **Granular observability** — Step start, retry, failure, patch, skip, reflection events all published via EventBus for full plan execution visibility

#### Tool Metrics & Prompt Quality (`@reactive-agents/reasoning`)

- **ToolCallCompleted events from plan-execute** — Direct tool dispatch now publishes `ToolCallCompleted` to EventBus so MetricsCollector tracks tool calls in the dashboard (was missing because plan-execute bypasses the execution engine's act phase)
- **`{{from_step:sN}}` self-reference guard** — Runtime check fails the step if unresolved references remain in toolArgs (prevents literal `{{from_step:s3}}` being sent as message content)
- **Plan generation self-reference prevention** — Prompt now explicitly states steps can ONLY reference EARLIER steps (s3 can reference s1/s2, not s3)
- **Analysis step directive prompt** — System prompt changed to "Produce the requested content directly. Never ask questions or offer to do something" to prevent conversational output like "Would you like me to send this?"
- **Step execution structured RULES** — Added explicit rules: no labels/prefixes, no follow-up questions, output is passed directly to next step

---

## [Phase A Foundation Fixes]

### Added

#### Strategy Type Threading (`@reactive-agents/reasoning`)

Full type-safe parameter threading from execution engine through all 5 reasoning strategies:

- **`StrategyFn` type extended** — `resultCompression`, `contextProfile`, `taskId`, `agentId`, `sessionId` now explicitly typed (was silently accepted via structural typing)
- **`resultCompression` wired** — All 3 kernel-backed strategies (Reflexion, Plan-Execute, ToT) forward compression config to `executeReActKernel()`
- **`kernelMaxIterations` config** — Reflexion: `config.strategies.reflexion.kernelMaxIterations` (default 3); Plan-Execute: `config.strategies.planExecute.stepKernelMaxIterations` (default 2)
- **Real `agentId`/`sessionId`** — Replaces hard-coded `"reasoning-agent"`/`"reasoning-session"` in react-kernel.ts and reactive.ts; execution engine passes `config.agentId` and `taskId`

#### Reflexion Cross-Run Learning (`@reactive-agents/reasoning` + `@reactive-agents/runtime`)

- **`priorCritiques`** — New optional field on `ReflexionInput`; seeds the critique loop from prior episodic memory
- **Critique persistence** — After reflexion completes, critiques stored to episodic memory tagged `["reflexion", "critique", taskType]`

#### Hallucination Detection Layer (`@reactive-agents/verification`)

New verification layer for catching fabricated claims:

- **`extractClaims(text)`** — Heuristic sentence-level claim extraction with confidence classification (certain/likely/uncertain)
- **`checkHallucination(response, source, threshold?)`** — Keyword overlap verification, passes if rate ≤ 10%
- **`checkHallucinationLLM(response, source, llm, threshold?)`** — LLM-based claim extraction + verification, falls back to heuristic
- **Verification pipeline integration** — Wired as optional layer via `enableHallucinationDetection` config flag

#### `@reactive-agents/testing` — New Package

Reusable test infrastructure for agent testing:

- **`createMockLLM(rules)`** — Ordered rule matching with call tracking
- **`createMockLLMFromMap(responses)`** — Simple key→response mapping
- **`createMockToolService(toolResults)`** — Records calls, returns configured results
- **`createMockEventBus()`** — Captures published events for assertion
- **`assertToolCalled()`**, **`assertStepCount()`**, **`assertCostUnder()`** — Test assertion helpers

### Changed

- `@reactive-agents/reasoning`: All strategy input types (`ReactiveInput`, `ReflexionInput`, `PlanExecuteInput`, `TreeOfThoughtInput`, `AdaptiveInput`) now include `agentId?`, `sessionId?`, `resultCompression?`
- `@reactive-agents/reasoning`: `ReasoningService.execute` params extended with `taskId`, `resultCompression`, `agentId`, `sessionId`
- `@reactive-agents/verification`: `VerificationConfigSchema` extended with `enableHallucinationDetection`, `hallucinationThreshold`

### Stats
- 1179 tests across 160 files (was 1116/156 before Phase A, +63 new tests)

---

## [Unreleased — Prior] — Strategy SDK Refactor

### Added

#### Shared Reasoning Kernel (`@reactive-agents/reasoning`)

Extracted a shared execution primitive and utility library from the 5 reasoning strategy files:

- **`shared/react-kernel.ts`** — `executeReActKernel()` — the ReAct Think→Act→Observe loop extracted from `reactive.ts` and parameterized for reuse by all strategies. Accepts `priorContext`, `availableToolSchemas`, `maxIterations`, `contextProfile`, `resultCompression`, `taskId`, `parentStrategy`.
- **`shared/tool-utils.ts`** — `parseToolRequest`, `parseAllToolRequests`, `hasFinalAnswer`, `extractFinalAnswer`, `evaluateTransform`, `formatToolSchemas`, `compressToolResult` (consolidated from reactive.ts + kernel copy)
- **`shared/quality-utils.ts`** — `isSatisfied`, `isCritiqueStagnant`, `parseScore`
- **`shared/context-utils.ts`** — `buildCompactedContext`, `formatStepForContext`
- **`shared/service-utils.ts`** — `resolveStrategyServices`, `compilePromptOrFallback`, `publishReasoningStep`
- **`shared/step-utils.ts`** — `makeStep`, `buildStrategyResult`
- **`shared/index.ts`** — barrel export for entire shared layer

#### Tool Awareness for All Strategies

All 5 strategies are now tool-aware:

- **Reflexion** — generation and improvement passes call `executeReActKernel`; critique pass stays pure LLM
- **Plan-Execute** — each plan step runs through the kernel (`maxIterations: 2` per step)
- **Tree-of-Thought** — Phase 2 execution (best-path follow-through) replaced with single kernel call
- **Adaptive** — threads `availableToolSchemas` to all dispatched sub-strategies
- **Reactive** — unchanged algorithm; private duplicates removed, shared imports added

#### New Input Fields

`availableToolSchemas?: readonly ToolSchema[]` added to `ReflexionInput`, `PlanExecuteInput`, `TreeOfThoughtInput`, `AdaptiveInput`.

### Changed

- `@reactive-agents/reasoning`: `reactive.ts` — removed private duplicates (`hasFinalAnswer`, `extractFinalAnswer`, `parseToolRequest*`, `formatStepForContext`, `buildCompactedContext`, `compilePromptOrFallback`, local `ToolSchema`/`ToolParamSchema`), replaced with shared imports. Re-exports `evaluateTransform` and `parseToolRequestWithTransform` for backwards compat.
- `@reactive-agents/reasoning`: `reflexion.ts`, `plan-execute.ts`, `tree-of-thought.ts` — removed local copies of `isSatisfied`, `isCritiqueStagnant`, `compilePromptOrFallback`, `buildResult`; all `tot*` duplicate parsing functions removed.
- `@reactive-agents/reasoning`: `adaptive.ts` — replaced boilerplate with shared utils.
- `compressToolResult` + `nextToolResultKey` consolidated into `shared/tool-utils.ts` — previously live in `reactive.ts` and duplicated in `react-kernel.ts`.

### Stats
- 1116 tests across 156 files (was 1001/139 in v0.5.6, +115 new tests)
- Feature gap analysis: `spec/plans/2026-03-01-feature-gap-analysis.md` — 8 gaps documented for v0.5.7 planning

---

## [0.5.6] — 2026-02-28

### Added

#### Agent Gateway (`@reactive-agents/gateway`) — New Package

Persistent autonomous agent harness that runs agents as long-lived services with deterministic infrastructure:

- **GatewayService** — central orchestrator with policy-driven event processing, stats tracking, and state management
- **PolicyEngine** — composable policy chain (sorted by priority, first non-null decision wins) with 4 built-in policies:
  - **AdaptiveHeartbeat** — skip ticks when agent state unchanged (3 modes: always, adaptive, conservative)
  - **CostBudget** — daily token budget enforcement with critical-priority bypass
  - **RateLimit** — hourly action cap with critical-priority bypass
  - **EventMerging** — deduplicate events sharing the same merge key
- **SchedulerService** — zero-dependency cron parser (5-field standard syntax with steps, ranges, day names), heartbeat/cron event factories
- **WebhookService** — route-based dispatch with signature validation adapters:
  - **GitHub adapter** — HMAC-SHA256 signature validation via `crypto.createHmac` + `timingSafeEqual`
  - **Generic adapter** — configurable signature header/algorithm for arbitrary webhook sources
- **InputRouter** — routes events through policies, publishes `GatewayEventReceived` and `ProactiveActionSuppressed` to EventBus
- **10 new EventBus event types**: `GatewayStarted`, `GatewayStopped`, `GatewayEventReceived`, `ProactiveActionInitiated`, `ProactiveActionCompleted`, `ProactiveActionSuppressed`, `PolicyDecisionMade`, `HeartbeatSkipped`, `EventsMerged`, `BudgetExhausted`
- **Builder integration**: `.withGateway(options?)` on `ReactiveAgentBuilder`, wired through `createRuntime()`
- **Design philosophy**: "Harness vs Horse" — deterministic infrastructure handles event routing without LLM calls; LLM only invoked when intelligence is genuinely needed

### Changed

- `@reactive-agents/core` 0.5.5 → 0.5.6: 10 new gateway event variants in `AgentEvent` union
- `@reactive-agents/runtime` 0.5.5 → 0.5.6: `.withGateway()` builder method, `enableGateway`/`gatewayOptions` in `RuntimeOptions`

### Stats
- 1001 tests across 139 files (was 909/124 in v0.5.5, +92 new tests)
- 18 packages (was 17)

---

## [0.5.5] — 2026-02-27

### Added

#### Full Real-Time EventBus Coverage (`@reactive-agents/core`, `@reactive-agents/runtime`, `@reactive-agents/reasoning`, `@reactive-agents/guardrails`, `@reactive-agents/memory`)

**New event types in `AgentEvent` union:**
- **`AgentStarted`** — emitted before Phase 1 (BOOTSTRAP) with `taskId`, `agentId`, `provider`, `model`, `timestamp`
- **`AgentCompleted`** — emitted in the COMPLETE phase with `totalIterations`, `totalTokens`, `durationMs`
- **`LLMRequestStarted`** — emitted before each `llm.complete()` call in the direct-LLM path; shares `requestId` with the existing `LLMRequestCompleted` for request correlation
- **`FinalAnswerProduced`** — emitted when a reasoning strategy reaches its final answer, with `strategy`, `answer`, `iteration`, `totalTokens`
- **`GuardrailViolationDetected`** — emitted before `GuardrailViolationError` is thrown, with the `violations` array, `score`, and `blocked: true`

**Previously defined but never emitted — now wired:**
- `ExecutionHookFired` — emitted after each lifecycle hook fires (`timing: "before"` | `"after"`)
- `ExecutionCancelled` — emitted before the `ExecutionError` fail when a task is cancelled
- `AgentPaused` / `AgentResumed` — emitted from `KillSwitchService.pause()` and `.resume()`
- `AgentStopped` — emitted when `stop()` is confirmed in `checkLifecycle`
- `MemoryBootstrapped` — emitted from `MemoryServiceLive.bootstrap()` after context is loaded
- `MemoryFlushed` — emitted from `MemoryServiceLive.flush()` after memory.md is written

**taskId correlation bug fixed:**
- All 5 reasoning strategies (`reactive`, `plan-execute`, `tree-of-thought`, `reflexion`, `adaptive`) hardcoded their own name as the `taskId` in `ReasoningStepCompleted` events, making cross-event correlation impossible
- Added `readonly taskId?: string` to all 5 strategy input interfaces
- Execution engine now passes `taskId: ctx.taskId` to `ReasoningService.execute()`
- All emit sites now use `input.taskId ?? "strategyName"` (safe fallback)

#### Professional Metrics Dashboard (`@reactive-agents/observability`, `@reactive-agents/runtime`)

Agents with observability enabled now render a structured execution summary on completion:

- **`MetricsCollector`** — auto-subscribed to EventBus `ToolCallCompleted` events via `MetricsCollectorLive` layer; no manual instrumentation required
- **`formatMetricsDashboard(metrics)`** — renders a 4-section dashboard:
  - **Header card** — overall status, total duration, step count, tokens, estimated cost (~$0.003/1M tokens), model name
  - **Execution timeline** — per-phase duration with percentage of total time; ⚠️ icons for phases ≥10s
  - **Tool execution summary** — grouped by tool name: success count, error count, average duration
  - **Alerts & insights** — smart warnings about bottlenecks, high iteration counts, tool failures (only shown when relevant)
- **`exportMetrics()`** — prints the formatted dashboard to stdout; wired into `ConsoleExporter.flush()`
- **Tool execution tracking** — `ExecutionEngine` records each tool call with name, duration, and success/error status into `MetricsCollector`
- **20 new tests** across metrics collector, dashboard formatter, and wiring

#### Reasoning Strategy Fixes (`@reactive-agents/reasoning`, `@reactive-agents/runtime`)

- **`defaultStrategy` wired end-to-end** — `.withReasoning({ defaultStrategy: "plan-execute" })` now correctly propagates through `RuntimeOptions` → `ReactiveAgentsConfig` → `ReasoningService.execute()` → strategy selection; was previously silently ignored
- **Tree-of-Thought plan-then-execute** — ToT now uses a two-phase approach: BFS planning generates the thought tree, then the best branch is executed via ReAct tool loop; replaces naive single-pass synthesis
- **Adaptive routing connected** — `adaptive.enabled` flag now gates delegation to sub-strategies; previously the flag existed in config but was never checked
- **ToT score parsing robustness** — score extraction regex updated to handle thinking-mode LLM outputs that wrap scores in XML tags or extra whitespace

#### Tool Result Compression (`@reactive-agents/reasoning`, `@reactive-agents/tools`, `@reactive-agents/runtime`)

Replaces blind `head+tail` truncation with structured, accurate compression for large tool results:

- **`compressToolResult(result, toolName, budget, previewItems)`** — detects JSON arrays, JSON objects, and plain text; generates compact structured previews that fit within budget
  - JSON arrays: shows item count, flattened schema (top-level + one-level-deep keys), and first N items as compact `key=val` rows
  - JSON objects: shows top-level keys with values (strings truncated to 60 chars, nested objects shown as `{...}`)
  - Plain text: shows first N lines with total line count
- **Scratchpad overflow store** — full result auto-stored in per-execution `Map<string, string>` under `_tool_result_N` key; agent can retrieve via `scratchpad-read("_tool_result_N")`
- **`scratchpad-read` short-circuit** — when agent calls `scratchpad-read("_tool_result_N")`, the execution engine intercepts before hitting the tool and returns the stored value directly
- **Pipe transform syntax** — `ACTION: tool(args) | transform: <js-expr>` evaluated in-process via `new Function("result", ...)` so only the transform output enters context; falls back to standard preview on error
- **`ResultCompressionConfig`** type in `@reactive-agents/tools` — `{ budget?, previewItems?, autoStore?, codeTransform? }` — user-configurable on `.withTools({ resultCompression: {...} })`
- **ReAct prompt updated** — explains `[STORED: ...]` format and `| transform:` syntax so models know how to use both mechanisms
- **15 new tests** in `packages/reasoning/tests/strategies/reactive-compression.test.ts` covering preview generation, pipe parsing, transform evaluation, and wiring

#### MCP Streamable-HTTP Transport (`@reactive-agents/tools`)

- **`streamable-http` transport type** — new MCP transport mode that connects to remote MCP servers over HTTP with streaming support (complements existing `stdio` and `sse` transports)
- **Headers, env, and cwd support** — `MCPServerConfig` extended with `headers?: Record<string, string>`, `env?: Record<string, string>`, and `cwd?: string` for full subprocess and remote server configuration
- **Spec compliance** — MCP tool discovery and invocation now follows the MCP 1.0 spec more strictly; `tools/call` result handling updated to extract text content from structured response parts

#### Examples Suite (`apps/examples`)

- **21 runnable examples** organized into 5 categories: `foundations/`, `tools/`, `multi-agent/`, `trust/`, `advanced/`, `interaction/`
- **Unified `index.ts` runner** — `bun run index.ts [category] [--live]` runs all or filtered examples; `--live` mode uses real LLM providers
- **Category READMEs** — each category has a README explaining the examples and prerequisites
- **New examples added**:
  - `tools/05-builtin-tools`, `tools/06-mcp-filesystem`, `tools/07-mcp-github`
  - `multi-agent/08-a2a-protocol`, `multi-agent/09-orchestration`, `multi-agent/10-dynamic-spawning`
  - `trust/11-identity`, `trust/12-guardrails`, `trust/13-verification`
  - `advanced/14-cost-tracking` through `advanced/18-self-improvement`
  - `reasoning/19-react`, `reasoning/20-plan-execute`, `interaction/21-interaction-modes`

### Fixed

- **`scratchpad-read` bare string arg** — calling `scratchpad-read("_tool_result_1")` now correctly resolves the key; previously fell back to `args.key` which was `undefined` on a string value
- **Pipe transform line boundary** — transform expression no longer captures trailing newlines or subsequent text when the model writes multi-line thoughts
- **Cost-route model routing** — `complexity-router` now correctly selects model tiers for non-Anthropic providers (OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama, LiteLLM); was previously defaulting to Anthropic model names for all providers
- **MCP connections scope** — MCP server connections are now established inside `Layer.effectDiscard` scope so they are properly torn down and re-established on each `agent.run()` call

### Changed

- `@reactive-agents/core` 0.2.0 → 0.5.5: typed `EventBus.on<T>()`, 5 new event types, `AgentEventTag` and `TypedEventHandler<T>` exports
- `@reactive-agents/cost` 0.2.0 → 0.5.5: complexity-router model routing fix for non-Anthropic providers
- `@reactive-agents/guardrails` 0.1.0 → 0.5.5: `GuardrailViolationDetected` event emission wired
- `@reactive-agents/identity` 0.1.0 → 0.5.5: `MemoryBootstrapped` / `MemoryFlushed` event wiring (via memory service)
- `@reactive-agents/llm-provider` 0.5.0 → 0.5.5: `LLMRequestStarted` event emission in direct-LLM path
- `@reactive-agents/memory` 0.1.0 → 0.5.5: emits `MemoryBootstrapped` from `bootstrap()` and `MemoryFlushed` from `flush()`
- `@reactive-agents/observability` 0.2.0 → 0.5.5: `MetricsCollector`, `formatMetricsDashboard()`, `exportMetrics()`, tool execution tracking
- `@reactive-agents/prompts` 0.1.0 → 0.5.5: no API changes; version aligned to release
- `@reactive-agents/reasoning` 0.5.1 → 0.5.5: strategy fixes (defaultStrategy, ToT plan-then-execute, adaptive routing, score parsing), tool result compression, taskId correlation
- `@reactive-agents/runtime` 0.5.4 → 0.5.5: metrics wiring, MCP scope fix, execution engine tool tracking
- `@reactive-agents/tools` 0.4.1 → 0.5.5: `ResultCompressionConfig`, streamable-http MCP transport, headers/env/cwd in `MCPServerConfig`
- `@reactive-agents/verification` 0.2.0 → 0.5.5: no API changes; version aligned to release
- `reactive-agents` meta-package 0.5.2 → 0.5.5
- `@reactive-agents/cli` 0.5.4 → 0.5.5

### Stats
- 909 tests across 124 files (was 855/120 in v0.5.3, +54 new tests)
- 21 example apps across 6 categories

## [0.5.3] — 2026-02-25

### Added

#### Real Ed25519 Cryptography (`@reactive-agents/identity`)
- **`crypto.subtle.generateKey("Ed25519")`** — real asymmetric key generation for agent certificates, replacing placeholder key stubs
- **Signature verification** — `crypto.subtle.sign()` / `crypto.subtle.verify()` used for certificate authentication
- **SHA-256 fingerprints** — certificate fingerprints computed via `crypto.subtle.digest("SHA-256")` over the DER-encoded public key

#### LiteLLM Provider (`@reactive-agents/llm-provider`)
- **5th LLM provider adapter**: `packages/llm-provider/src/providers/litellm.ts` — connects to any LiteLLM proxy endpoint, unlocking 100+ model backends (OpenAI-compatible format)
- Builder: `.withProvider("litellm")` — requires `LITELLM_BASE_URL` env var (e.g., `http://localhost:4000`)
- Full tool calling, streaming, and structured output support via the LiteLLM OpenAI-compatible API

#### Kill Switch & Lifecycle Control (`@reactive-agents/guardrails`)
- **`KillSwitchService`** — per-agent and global halt capability with full lifecycle control API:
  - `trigger(agentId, reason)` — hard stop at next phase boundary
  - `triggerGlobal(reason)` — halt all agents globally
  - `pause(agentId)` / `resume(agentId)` — suspend and resume execution at phase boundaries
  - `stop(agentId, reason)` — graceful stop (completes current phase, then exits)
  - `terminate(agentId, reason)` — immediate termination
  - `getLifecycle(agentId)` — query current state: `"running" | "paused" | "stopping" | "terminated" | "unknown"`
  - `waitIfPaused(agentId)` — used by execution engine to block at phase boundaries when paused
- Builder: `.withKillSwitch()` — wires `KillSwitchService` and exposes `agent.pause()`, `agent.resume()`, `agent.stop()`, `agent.terminate()` on the `ReactiveAgent` facade
- `guardedPhase()` wrapper — every execution phase is wrapped to check kill switch state before entering
- Emits `AgentPaused` / `AgentResumed` / `AgentStopped` events to EventBus when wired

#### Behavioral Contracts (`@reactive-agents/guardrails`)
- **`.withBehavioralContracts(contract)`** builder method — enforces typed behavioral boundaries:
  - `deniedTools: string[]` — tool names the agent may never call
  - `allowedTools: string[]` — if set, only these tools may be called (whitelist)
  - `maxIterations: number` — per-contract iteration cap that cannot be overridden at runtime
- Contract violations throw `BehavioralContractError` at the guardrail phase before the LLM executes

#### Code Sandbox via Subprocess (`@reactive-agents/tools`)
- **`Bun.spawn()` isolation** in `packages/tools/src/skills/code-execution.ts` — code snippets now execute in a subprocess with `cwd: "/tmp"` and a minimal environment (`PATH` only, no inherited secrets)
- Replaces the previous `new Function()` eval approach; prevents environment variable leakage and file system escapes

#### Multi-Source Verification (`@reactive-agents/verification`)
- **Real LLM claim extraction + Tavily search** in `packages/verification/src/layers/multi-source.ts` — the Multi-Source verification layer now extracts factual claims from the output via LLM, then cross-references each claim with a Tavily web search
- Previously documented as "not fully implemented"; now functional when `TAVILY_API_KEY` is set

#### Prompt A/B Experiment Framework (`@reactive-agents/prompts`)
- **`ExperimentService`** in `packages/prompts/src/services/experiment-service.ts` — structured A/B testing for prompt variants
- Define experiments with variant groups, traffic splits, and success metrics; `ExperimentService.assign()` deterministically routes requests to variants; `ExperimentService.record()` logs outcomes for analysis

#### Cross-Task Self-Improvement (`@reactive-agents/runtime`, `@reactive-agents/reasoning`)
- **`StrategyOutcome` episodic logging** — after each completed task, strategy name, task description, outcome (success/failure), and step count are logged as episodic memories
- **`.withSelfImprovement()`** builder method — enables outcome logging and retrieves relevant past strategy outcomes at bootstrap to bias strategy selection on similar future tasks

#### Integration Scenarios
- **S14** (`test.ts`) — code sandbox env isolation: verifies spawned code processes cannot read `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from the environment
- **S15** (`test.ts`) — self-improvement two-run scenario: second run on similar task uses fewer iterations than first run, validated via episodic memory retrieval

### Changed
- `@reactive-agents/identity` 0.5.2 → 0.5.3: real Ed25519 key generation and signature verification
- `@reactive-agents/llm-provider` 0.5.0 → 0.5.3: LiteLLM adapter (5th provider)
- `@reactive-agents/guardrails` 0.5.2 → 0.5.3: KillSwitchService, BehavioralContractError, `.withKillSwitch()` / `.withBehavioralContracts()`
- `@reactive-agents/tools` 0.5.1 → 0.5.3: Bun.spawn subprocess isolation in code-execute handler
- `@reactive-agents/verification` 0.5.2 → 0.5.3: functional Multi-Source layer with LLM + Tavily
- `@reactive-agents/prompts` 0.2.0 → 0.5.3: ExperimentService
- `@reactive-agents/runtime` 0.5.2 → 0.5.3: `.withSelfImprovement()` builder method, StrategyOutcome logging
- `@reactive-agents/reasoning` 0.5.1 → 0.5.3: StrategyOutcome type, episodic outcome logging

### Stats
- 855 tests across 120 files (was 812/116 in v0.5.2, +43 new tests)
- 2 new integration scenarios: S14 (code sandbox), S15 (self-improvement)

---

## [0.5.2] — 2026-02-24

### Added

#### Agent Persona / Steering API (`@reactive-agents/runtime`, `@reactive-agents/reasoning`, `@reactive-agents/tools`)

- **`AgentPersona` Interface** — Structured alternative to raw system prompts. Fields: `name?`, `role?`, `background?`, `instructions?`, `tone?` — all optional.
- **`.withPersona(persona)` Builder Method** — Enables steerable, type-safe behavior configuration for main agents. Personas are composed into system prompt sections.
- **Persona Composition** — When both persona and systemPrompt are set, persona comes first (`${personaPrompt}\n\n${systemPrompt}`), allowing layered behavior guidance.
- **Subagent Personas** — Static subagents (`.withAgentTool()`) and dynamic subagents (`spawn-agent` tool) now accept persona configuration. Parent agents can dynamically generate persona parameters (`role`, `instructions`, `tone`) to steer specialized subagents at runtime.
- **Enhanced `spawn-agent` Tool** — New tool parameters enable parent agents to specify subagent personas: `role` (e.g., "Data Analyst"), `instructions` (e.g., "Focus on accuracy"), `tone` (e.g., "professional").

#### Critical Bug Fix: System Prompt Forwarding in Reasoning Path
- **Bug**: When `enableReasoning: true`, custom systemPrompt (from `.withSystemPrompt()` or composed persona) was silently ignored by all reasoning strategies (ReAct, Plan-Execute, Tree-of-Thought, Reflexion, Adaptive).
- **Root Cause**: ReasoningService had no mechanism to pass systemPrompt to strategies; each strategy hardcoded its own default fallback.
- **Fix** (6 files):
  1. Added `systemPrompt?: string` to `ReasoningService.execute()` params
  2. Added `systemPrompt?: string` to `StrategyFn` type in strategy-registry
  3. Updated all 5 strategy input types to include `systemPrompt?`
  4. Updated all 5 strategies to use `input.systemPrompt` in fallback when available
  5. Updated execution-engine to pass `config.systemPrompt` to reasoning execute
  6. Fixed Context.GenericTag type in execution-engine to include systemPrompt

### Changed

- `@reactive-agents/reasoning` 0.5.0 → 0.5.1: ReasoningService params include systemPrompt, all strategies accept and use systemPrompt
- `@reactive-agents/tools` 0.4.0 → 0.4.1: SubAgentConfig includes persona, spawn-agent tool has role/instructions/tone parameters

### Stats
- 812 tests across 116 files (was 804/114 in v0.5.1, +8 new tests)
- 2 new test files: `persona.test.ts`, `subagent-persona.test.ts`

## [0.5.1] — 2026-02-24

### Added

#### Context Engineering Revolution (`@reactive-agents/reasoning`, `@reactive-agents/tools`, `@reactive-agents/runtime`)

- **Structured Tool Observations** (`ObservationResult`) — Typed replacement for `startsWith("✓")` string checks. Every tool result now carries `{ success, toolName, category, resultKind, preserveOnCompaction }`. Categories: `file-write`, `file-read`, `web-search`, `http-get`, `code-execute`, `agent-delegate`, `scratchpad`, `custom`, `error`.
- **Model Context Profiles** — Four model tiers (`local`, `mid`, `large`, `frontier`) each with calibrated thresholds: compaction frequency, full-detail window, tool result size limits, rules complexity, prompt verbosity, and tool schema detail. Builder API: `.withContextProfile({ tier: "local" })`.
- **Context Budget System** — `allocateBudget()` dynamically allocates token budget per section (system prompt, tool schemas, memory, step history, rules). Budget tracks usage per iteration and adapts aggressiveness as tasks progress.
- **Real Sub-Agent Tool** — `.withAgentTool(name, config)` now spawns real sub-runtimes (clean context, focused task, structured `SubAgentResult` summary capped at 1500 chars). Depth-limited to `MAX_RECURSION_DEPTH=3`. Previously this was a stub.
- **Scratchpad Built-in Tool** — Two new built-in tools: `scratchpad-write(key, content)` and `scratchpad-read(key?)`. Persistent notes outside the context window — survives compaction. Total built-in tools: 7 (was 5).
- **Progressive Context Compaction** — Four-level compaction: full detail → one-line summary → grouped sequence → dropped. Uses `ObservationResult.preserveOnCompaction` to protect error steps and important observations. Budget-adaptive: escalates level under pressure.
- **Prompt Template Variants** — Tier-aware prompt resolution: compiles `${templateId}:${tier}` first, falls back to base template. New templates: `react-system:local` (ultra-lean), `react-system:frontier` (rich guidance), `react-thought:local`, `react-thought:frontier`.

#### New Exports (`@reactive-agents/reasoning`)
- `ModelTier`, `ContextProfileSchema`, `ContextProfile`, `CONTEXT_PROFILES`, `mergeProfile`, `resolveProfile`
- `ContextBudgetSchema`, `ContextBudget`, `allocateBudget`, `estimateTokens`, `wouldExceedBudget`, `trackUsage`
- `ObservationResult`, `ObservationResultSchema`, `ObservationCategory`, `ResultKind`, `categorizeToolName`, `deriveResultKind`
- Progressive compaction utilities: `formatStepFull`, `formatStepSummary`, `shouldPreserve`, `clearOldToolResults`, `groupToolSequences`, `progressiveSummarize`

#### Dynamic Sub-Agent Spawning (`@reactive-agents/tools`, `@reactive-agents/runtime`)

- **`withDynamicSubAgents(options?)`** builder method — registers the built-in `spawn-agent` tool, enabling the model to delegate subtasks to ad-hoc sub-agents at runtime without pre-configured named agent tools
- **`createSpawnAgentTool()`** exported from `@reactive-agents/tools` — constructs the `spawn-agent` ToolDefinition with parameters: `task` (required), `name?`, `model?`, `maxIterations?`
- Sub-agents receive a clean context window with no parent history; inherit parent's provider and model by default
- Depth-guarded at `MAX_RECURSION_DEPTH = 3`; spawned sub-agents do not receive `spawn-agent` by default, naturally containing recursion
- Tool result routed through the `agent-delegate` observation category (same as `.withAgentTool()`)
- **test.ts S13** scenario added for dynamic spawn; 12/12 pass (7.7 avg steps, 2,366 avg tokens, 4.8s avg)
- Total built-in tools: **8** (was 7)

#### New Exports (`@reactive-agents/tools`)
- `SubAgentConfig`, `SubAgentResult`, `createSubAgentExecutor`
- `scratchpadWriteTool`, `scratchpadReadTool`, `makeScratchpadStore`, `makeScratchpadWriteHandler`, `makeScratchpadReadHandler`
- `createSpawnAgentTool`

#### Type Safety
- Replaced all `as any` casts introduced by context engineering with specific types: branded `Task`/`TaskResult` via `generateTaskId()`/`Schema.decodeSync(AgentId)()`, `Partial<ContextProfile>` replacing `unknown`, typed `RemoteAgentClient` parameters, narrow service interface assertions for dynamic ToolService access.
- `ReactiveAgent` engine type updated from `(task: any) => Effect<any, any>` to properly typed `(task: Task) => Effect<TaskResult, RuntimeErrors | TaskError>`.
- `contextProfile` in config schema updated from `Schema.Unknown` to `Schema.partial(ContextProfileSchema)`.

### Changed
- `@reactive-agents/reasoning` 0.4.0 → 0.5.0: context engineering types, profiles, budget, compaction, observation result
- `@reactive-agents/tools` 0.3.0 → 0.4.0: sub-agent executor, scratchpad tools, spawn-agent tool (8 built-ins)
- `@reactive-agents/runtime` 0.5.0 → 0.5.1: `.withContextProfile()` builder method, real sub-agent wiring, type safety
- `@reactive-agents/prompts` 0.1.0 → 0.2.0: tier-aware variant resolution, 4 new tier-specific templates

### Fixed
- Fixed Layer scope bug where `withAgentTool()` and `withDynamicSubAgents()` tool registrations were lost between `build()` and `run()` calls — agent and spawn-agent tools are now always available on every `run()` call by composing registrations as `Layer.effectDiscard` baked into the runtime layer so they re-run on every scope evaluation

### Stats
- 804 tests across 114 files (was 720/106 in v0.5.0, +84 new tests)
- 7 new test files: `observation.test.ts`, `context-profile.test.ts`, `context-budget.test.ts`, `compaction.test.ts`, `sub-agent.test.ts`, `scratchpad.test.ts`, `prompt-variants.test.ts`
- Verified with real Ollama agent (cogito:14b): 8/9 scenarios pass, avg 6.4 steps, 2,093 tokens, 4.4s

## [0.5.0] — 2026-02-23

### Added

#### A2A Protocol Package (`@reactive-agents/a2a` 0.1.0) — NEW
- **Full A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol implementation** based on Google's A2A specification
- **Agent Card** — `generateAgentCard()` pure function produces A2A-compliant Agent Cards with skills, capabilities, and provider metadata; `toolsToSkills()` maps tool definitions to `AgentSkill[]`
- **JSON-RPC 2.0 Server** — `A2AHttpServer` with `Bun.serve()` binding, routes `message/send`, `message/stream`, `tasks/get`, `tasks/cancel`, `agent/card`; serves `GET /.well-known/agent.json` for standard agent discovery
- **Task Handler** — `createTaskHandler()` persists tasks via Effect `Ref`, transitions through `submitted → working → completed/failed` states, extracts text from message parts, stores artifacts on completion
- **SSE Streaming** — `createSSEStream()` produces `ReadableStream` + `Queue` for real-time task updates; `formatSSEEvent()` serializes events with JSON-RPC 2.0 wrapping
- **Client** — `A2AClient` (Effect-TS service) with `sendMessage()`, `getTask()`, `cancelTask()`, `getAgentCard()` via fetch-based JSON-RPC; supports bearer and API key auth
- **Discovery** — `discoverAgent()` tries `/.well-known/agent.json` then falls back to `/agent/card`; `discoverMultipleAgents()` runs up to 5 discoveries concurrently
- **Capability Matcher** — `matchCapabilities()` scores agents by skill ID (10pts), tag overlap (5pts each), input mode (2pts each); `findBestAgent()` returns top-scoring result
- **A2AService** — unified Effect-TS service wrapping both server and client operations
- **Types** — full Schema.Struct types: `AgentCard`, `A2ATask`, `A2AMessage`, `Part` (Text/File/Data), `Artifact`, `TaskState`, `JsonRpcRequest/Response`, `SendMessageParams`, `TaskQueryParams`, `TaskCancelParams`, `A2AServerConfig`
- **Errors** — `A2AError`, `DiscoveryError`, `TransportError`, `TaskNotFoundError`, `TaskCanceledError`, `InvalidTaskStateError`, `AuthenticationError`

#### Agent-as-Tool Pattern (`@reactive-agents/tools` 0.3.0, `@reactive-agents/runtime` 0.5.0)
- **`createAgentTool()`** — wraps a local agent as a `ToolDefinition`
- **`createRemoteAgentTool()`** — wraps a remote A2A client call as a tool with `MAX_RECURSION_DEPTH=3`
- **Builder wiring** — `.withAgentTool(name, config)` and `.withRemoteAgent(name, url)` now register tools via `ToolService` (was placeholder comment)
- Dynamic import of `ToolService` and adapters at build time; remote agents use `fetch`-based JSON-RPC

#### CLI A2A Support (`@reactive-agents/cli` 0.5.0)
- **`rax serve`** — fully functional A2A HTTP server via `Bun.serve()`:
  - `GET /.well-known/agent.json` and `GET /agent/card` for discovery
  - `POST /` JSON-RPC endpoint: `message/send` (runs agent async, returns taskId), `tasks/get`, `tasks/cancel`, `agent/card`
  - In-memory task store, SIGINT/SIGTERM graceful shutdown
  - Configurable: `--port`, `--name`, `--provider`, `--model`, `--with-tools`, `--with-reasoning`, `--with-memory`

#### Test Coverage Hardening (35+ new tests)
- `packages/a2a/tests/a2a-client.test.ts` — 6 tests: JSON-RPC send/get/cancel, discovery, transport errors, error propagation
- `packages/a2a/tests/agent-card.test.ts` — 6 tests: minimal/full config, defaults, toolsToSkills mapping
- `packages/a2a/tests/a2a-service.test.ts` — 6 tests: server integration, JSON-RPC routing, error mapping
- `packages/a2a/tests/integration.test.ts` — 6 tests: send→poll→complete, discovery, capability matching, full pipeline, task cancellation
- `packages/cost/tests/semantic-cache.test.ts` — 11 tests: cache hit/miss, TTL expiration, stats, eviction, case-insensitive matching

#### Example Apps
- `apps/examples/src/04-a2a-agents.ts` — two agents communicating via A2A protocol
- `apps/examples/src/05-agent-composition.ts` — agent-as-tool pattern with coordinator/specialist
- `apps/examples/src/06-remote-mcp.ts` — MCP server configuration (stdio + SSE transports)

#### Real-Time Observability (`@reactive-agents/observability`, `@reactive-agents/runtime`)
- **`withObservability({ verbosity, live, file? })`** — builder now accepts options:
  - `live: true` — each log line written to stdout immediately as it fires, not buffered until flush
  - `verbosity: "minimal" | "normal" | "verbose" | "debug"` — controls log detail level
  - `file?: string` — optional JSONL file exporter path
- **`LiveLogWriter`** — synchronous callback wired into `StructuredLogger` via `Effect.suspend`
- **`makeLiveLogWriter(options?)`** — factory exported from observability package; ANSI colors + timestamps
- **Structured phase logs**: `◉ [bootstrap/strategy/think/act/complete]` at `normal`; `┄ [thought/action/obs/llm/ctx]` at `verbose`/`debug` — streaming live as each step fires
- **`ConsoleExporter`** — ANSI-colored span tree with timing + metrics summary, printed at flush
- **`FileExporter`** — JSONL output with one entry per span/log
- **Tracer correlation IDs** — `withSpan()` propagates `traceId` via `FiberRef`; child spans inherit parent context

#### ThoughtTracer (`@reactive-agents/observability`)
- **`ThoughtTracerService`** — new Effect-TS service that auto-subscribes to `ReasoningStepCompleted` events and exposes `getThoughtChain(strategy)` / `clearChain()`
- **`ThoughtTracerLive`** — wired via `Layer.provideMerge(ThoughtTracerLive, EventBusLive)` pattern

#### EventBus Reasoning Events (`@reactive-agents/reasoning`)
- All 5 strategies (`reactive`, `plan-execute`, `tree-of-thought`, `reflexion`, `adaptive`) publish `ReasoningStepCompleted` via `Effect.serviceOption(EventBus)` after each thought/action/observation step
- No hard dependency — runs gracefully when EventBus is absent from context
- EventBus extended with `on(tag, handler)` method for filtered subscriptions

#### Foundation Hardening
- **Semantic cache embeddings** — `makeSemanticCache(embedFn?)` factory; cosine similarity matching (>0.92 threshold, hash fast path)
- **LLM-based prompt compressor** — `makePromptCompressor(llm?)` factory; heuristic first pass + LLM second pass when over `maxTokens`
- **InteractionManager approval gates** — `approvalGate()` waits async until `resolveApproval()` called; 5-minute timeout
- **WorkflowEngine approval gates** — `requiresApproval` on `WorkflowStep`; `approveStep()` / `rejectStep()` on `OrchestrationService`
- **LLM hook context enrichment** — `lastLLMRequest`, `lastLLMResponse`, `availableTools`, `traceId` in every hook context
- **LLM episodic memory** — LLM calls and tool results logged as episodic memory items during execution
- **Semantic entropy** — both heuristic + LLM-based (paraphrase embeddings) implementations in verification
- **Fact decomposition** — both heuristic + LLM-based (atomic claim extraction + status scoring) in verification
- **Feature contract tests** — 18 tests verifying user-observable behavior (hooks, iterations, tool visibility, stepsCount, tokensUsed, TaskResult shape)

- `@reactive-agents/llm-provider` 0.4.0 → 0.5.0: LLMRequestEvent type + ObservabilityVerbosity field
- Build order: added `@reactive-agents/a2a` to `build:packages` (after orchestration, before runtime)
- `serve.ts` uses lazy `import()` for `@reactive-agents/a2a` to avoid module resolution in non-serve contexts

### Fixed
- CI lockfile: `bun.lock` updated for new `@reactive-agents/a2a` package (was causing `--frozen-lockfile` failures)
- CLI test failures from top-level `@reactive-agents/a2a` import — converted to dynamic `import()` in `serve.ts`
- ReAct `iteration: 0` bug — fixed to start at 1

- `stepsCount: 0` in TaskResult — fixed: reads from reasoning result metadata
- `maxIterations` override silently ignored — `defaultReactiveAgentsConfig` now accepts optional overrides param

### Stats
- 720 tests across 106 files (was 442/77 in v0.4.0)
- 17 packages + 2 apps
- 3 new example apps (6 total)

## [0.3.0] — 2026-02-21

### Added

#### Foundation Integration — All Services Wired Through Execution Engine

The 10-phase execution engine now calls every configured service. Agents can think, use tools, observe results, verify output, track costs, and log audit trails — all in a single execution loop.

**Tools in Reasoning (C1)**
- `ReasoningService` captures `ToolService` optionally at layer construction time
- Strategies like ReAct receive ToolService in their Effect context — tools execute for real during reasoning
- `createRuntime()` restructured: tools layer built before reasoning layer and provided as a dependency

**OpenAI Function Calling (C2)**
- `toOpenAITool()` converter maps tool definitions to OpenAI's function_calling format
- `tools` array sent in OpenAI API request body when tools are provided
- `tool_calls` extracted from responses; `function.arguments` JSON parsed into `ToolCall[]`
- `finish_reason: "tool_calls"` mapped to `stopReason: "tool_use"`; `content: null` handled

**3 New Reasoning Strategies (C3)**
- **Plan-Execute-Reflect** — Generate plan → execute steps → reflect → refine (configurable `maxRefinements`, `reflectionDepth`)
- **Tree-of-Thought** — BFS expansion → score branches → prune below threshold → synthesize best path (configurable `breadth`, `depth`, `pruningThreshold`)
- **Adaptive** — Meta-strategy: analyze task complexity via LLM → delegate to optimal sub-strategy
- All 5 strategies registered in `StrategyRegistryLive` initial map

**Tool Type Adapter (C4)**
- Execution engine calls `toFunctionCallingFormat()` before LLM loop, converting tools package format to LLM-compatible `{ name, description, inputSchema }` format

**Token Tracking (C5)**
- `tokensUsed` added to `ExecutionContext` schema, initialized to 0
- Accumulated from `response.usage.totalTokens` after each LLM call
- Final `TaskResult` reports accurate token count (was hardcoded to 0)

**Observability Integration (H1)**
- `ObservabilityService` acquired optionally at start of `execute()`
- `runObservablePhase()` wrapper wraps every phase in `obs.withSpan()` when available
- All `runPhase()` calls replaced with `runObservablePhase()`
- Spans include `taskId`, `agentId`, and `phase` attributes

**Stub Phases Wired to Real Services (H2)**
- Phase 2 (Guardrail): `GuardrailService.check(inputText)` — fails with `GuardrailViolationError` if `!result.passed`
- Phase 3 (Cost Route): `CostService.routeToModel(task)` — selects optimal model tier
- Phase 6 (Verify): `VerificationService.verify(response, input)` — stores score and risk in context metadata
- Phase 8 (Cost Track): `CostService.recordCost()` — logs token counts, latency, and cost
- Phase 9 (Audit): `ObservabilityService.info()` — logs task summary with iterations, tokens, cost, strategy, duration

**Context Window Management (H3)**
- `ContextWindowManager.truncate()` called before each LLM call to stay within token limits

**Memory Integration in Reasoning Loop (H5)**
- OBSERVE phase logs tool results as episodic memories via `MemoryService.logEpisode()`
- Phase 7 (Memory Flush) calls `flush()` in addition to `snapshot()` for full persistence

#### Documentation Overhaul
- **12 new documentation pages** (28 total, up from 15)
- 7 feature docs: LLM Providers, Verification, Cost Tracking, Identity/RBAC, Observability, Orchestration, Prompt Templates
- 4 cookbook pages: Testing Agents, Multi-Agent Patterns, Custom Strategies, Production Deployment
- Rewritten landing page with tabbed code examples and framework comparison cards
- New sidebar sections: Features, Cookbook
- Neural network logo design, favicon

#### README Rewrite
- Architecture tables mapping phases to services
- Strategy comparison matrix with use cases
- Multi-provider capability matrix
- Cleaner badge layout, updated stats

#### New Tests
- `packages/runtime/tests/foundation-integration.test.ts` — token accumulation, tools-to-LLM, observability spans, guardrails/verify/cost phases, OpenAI tool_calls
- `packages/reasoning/tests/strategies/plan-execute.test.ts` — 3 tests
- `packages/reasoning/tests/strategies/tree-of-thought.test.ts` — 3 tests
- `packages/reasoning/tests/strategies/adaptive.test.ts` — 3 tests
- `packages/llm-provider/tests/openai-tools.test.ts` — OpenAI tool format

### Changed

## [0.2.1] — 2026-02-20

### Added

#### Evaluation Framework (`@reactive-agents/eval`)
- **`@reactive-agents/eval` 0.1.0** — LLM-as-judge evaluation framework for agent quality measurement
- 5 built-in scoring dimensions: `accuracy`, `relevance`, `completeness`, `safety`, `cost-efficiency`
- Custom dimension support via generic LLM-as-judge prompting
- `EvalService.runSuite(suite, agentConfig)` — runs all cases, scores all dimensions, builds summary with pass/fail counts
- `EvalService.runCase(evalCase, agentConfig, dimensions, actualOutput, metrics)` — score a single case with real agent output
- `EvalService.compare(runA, runB)` — per-dimension improvement/regression/unchanged classification (±0.02 delta threshold)
- `EvalService.checkRegression(current, baseline, threshold?)` — regression detection with configurable threshold (default 0.05)
- `EvalService.getHistory(suiteId)` — retrieve past runs from in-memory history ref
- `DatasetService.loadSuite(path)` — load eval suite from JSON file (Schema-validated)
- `DatasetService.loadSuitesFromDir(dir)` — batch-load all `*.json` suites from a directory
- `rax eval run --suite <path> [--provider anthropic|openai|test]` — CLI command with summary table and dimension score bars
- 11 tests: eval-service (7) and dataset-service (4)

### Changed
- `reactive-agents` meta-package 0.2.0 → 0.2.1: adds `@reactive-agents/eval` dep and `./eval` subpath export
- `@reactive-agents/cli` 0.2.0 → 0.2.1: real `rax eval run` implementation (was placeholder)
- `@reactive-agents/reasoning` type fixes for correct DTS output (no API changes)

### Fixed
- Build order: `@reactive-agents/tools` now builds before `@reactive-agents/reasoning` (DTS dependency)
- `reactive.ts` type errors in DTS output from `typeof ToolService.Service` — replaced with explicit local interface

### Stats
- 318 tests across 56 test files (was 307/54)

## [0.2.0] — 2026-02-20

### Added

#### Tools in Reasoning
- **ReAct strategy now executes real tools** — `ACTION: tool_name({"param": "value"})` JSON format is dispatched to registered tools via `ToolService`
- String arguments are mapped to the first required parameter of the tool definition as a fallback
- Tool errors are captured as observations (no crashes, no runaway loops); graceful degradation when `ToolService` is absent
- `ExecutionEngine` think phase populates `availableTools` from real registered tool names (was hardcoded empty `[]`)
- `ExecutionEngine` act phase calls real `ToolService.execute()` with `concurrency: 3` (was a `[Tool ${name} executed]` placeholder)
- 5 new integration tests in `packages/reasoning/tests/strategies/reactive-tool-integration.test.ts`

#### MCP Stdio Transport
- **Real stdio transport** for MCP (Model Context Protocol) via `Bun.spawn()` — line-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0
- Background stdout reader loop with pending request tracking and Promise-based resolution
- Subprocess kill on disconnect; `activeTransports` map for lifecycle management
- SSE and WebSocket transports remain stubs (planned for v0.2.x)

### Changed
- `@reactive-agents/reasoning` 0.1.0 → 0.2.0: adds `@reactive-agents/tools` dependency; ReAct rewired
- `@reactive-agents/tools` 0.1.1 → 0.2.0: MCP client rewritten with real stdio transport
- `@reactive-agents/runtime` 0.1.2 → 0.2.0: updated tools/reasoning deps; real act phase
- `@reactive-agents/cli` 0.1.7 → 0.2.0: updated runtime dep

### Stats
- 307 tests across 54 test files (was 300/52)

## [0.1.1] — 2026-02-20

### Added

#### Provider Improvements
- All 4 LLM providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama) handle both `string` and `ModelConfig` model parameters
- Gemini provider defaults to `gemini-2.5-flash` with fallback logic for non-Gemini model names
- **Reflexion reasoning strategy** — self-critique loop with reflection memory

#### Tools System
- `@reactive-agents/tools` — dynamic tool registration, execution, sandboxing, risk levels (`low`/`medium`/`high`/`critical`)
- Function-to-tool auto-adaptation: convert any TypeScript function to a typed tool
- Tool input validation with risk-level gates
- Sandbox with timeout enforcement and structured error handling

#### CLI Enhancements
- `rax run --tools` flag — register built-in tools for a run
- `rax run --reasoning` flag — enable reasoning strategy
- `rax run --model <model>` — select model at runtime
- Version string now read dynamically from `package.json` (no hardcoding)

### Fixed
- `ExecutionEngine` now reliably initializes `selectedModel` from config in bootstrap phase
- Model parameter plumbing verified end-to-end: builder → runtime config → execution context → LLM `complete()` call
- `ReasoningService.execute` takes a single `params` object (not positional args)
- CLI binary now uses Bun shebang for correct runtime detection
- npm dependency resolution fixed for published packages

### Changed
- `@reactive-agents/runtime` 0.1.0 → 0.1.1–0.1.2
- `@reactive-agents/cli` 0.1.0 → 0.1.2–0.1.7 (incremental fixes)
- `@reactive-agents/llm-provider` updated with model parameter handling
- Restored `reactive-agents` unscoped meta-package to npm registry
