# Reactive Agents: Plan Review & Critical Improvements

## Review Date: February 15, 2026

## Last Updated: February 22, 2026 (v0.4.0 release)

## Reviewer: AI Architecture Analysis

## Executive Assessment

The Reactive Agents spec is **ambitious and well-positioned strategically**. The 6 competitive advantages are genuine gaps in the market. ~~However, the spec has **15 critical issues** that will cause AI agents to produce inconsistent, broken, or incomplete code if not addressed before implementation begins.~~

**Original Score: 7/10** — Great vision, significant execution gaps.

**Updated Score (v0.4.0): 9/10** — Issues #1-10 fully resolved. Issues #11-15 are strategic gaps being addressed in v0.5.0 plan (`spec/docs/14-v0.5-comprehensive-plan.md`).

## CRITICAL Issues (Must Fix Before Building)

### 1. ✅ RESOLVED — NO LLM PROVIDER ABSTRACTION — Severity: BLOCKER

> **Resolution (v0.1.0):** `@reactive-agents/llm-provider` package created with `LLMService` (complete/stream/embed), 4 provider adapters (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama), test provider for deterministic testing. Spec: `01.5-layer-llm-provider.md`.

~~**The Problem:**~~
~~Layers 3 (Reasoning), 4 (Verification), and 5 (Cost) all call LLMs extensively. Code examples reference `this.llm.generate()`, `this.llm.complete()`, and `this.llm.embed()` — but **no LLMService is defined anywhere**.~~

**Fix:** A new spec document `01.5-layer-llm-provider.md` has been created alongside this review. It must be read before Layer 3 implementation begins. The LLMService should be part of the `@reactive-agents/core` package.

---

### 2. ✅ RESOLVED — EFFECT-TS PATTERN VIOLATIONS IN SPECS — Severity: HIGH

> **Resolution (v0.1.0-v0.3.0):** All 15 packages implemented with proper Effect-TS patterns. `effect-ts-patterns` skill enforces Schema.Struct, Data.TaggedError, Context.Tag + Layer.effect, Ref for state. No async/await in service implementations.

~~**The Problem:**~~
~~Spec code examples mixed async/await with Effect. Implementation corrected all patterns.~~

---

### 3. ✅ RESOLVED — LAYERS 4-9 SPECS ARE SKELETAL — Severity: HIGH

> **Resolution (v0.1.0-v0.3.0):** All layers fully implemented with Effect-TS services, tagged errors, layer composition, and tests. Specs expanded with `11-missing-capabilities-enhancement.md` covering guardrails, eval, prompts, and CLI.

---

### 4. ✅ RESOLVED — MISSING STRUCTURED OUTPUT PARSING — Severity: HIGH

> **Resolution (v0.2.0-v0.3.0):** ReAct uses `ACTION: tool_name({"param": "value"})` JSON format. OpenAI function calling via `toOpenAITool()`. All adapters parse tool_calls from responses. `Schema.Struct` used for all internal types. `completeStructured()` added to Ollama adapter for JSON mode.

---

### 5. ✅ RESOLVED — MISSING MONOREPO SETUP — Severity: MEDIUM

> **Resolution (v0.1.0):** Bun workspaces configured, root `tsconfig.json` with shared base, `tsup.config.ts` per package for ESM + DTS output, 3-phase build order documented in `architecture-reference` skill. 15 packages + 2 apps all building cleanly.

---

### 6. ✅ RESOLVED — NO CONTEXT WINDOW MANAGEMENT — Severity: MEDIUM

> **Resolution (v0.1.0-v0.3.0):** `ContextWindowManager` in core handles truncation before each LLM call. `@reactive-agents/prompts` package provides template engine with variable interpolation and token estimation. Working memory capped at Miller's number (7). History truncated via `truncate()` method in execution engine.

---

### 7. ⚠️ PARTIALLY RESOLVED — NO STREAMING ARCHITECTURE — Severity: MEDIUM

> **Status (v0.4.0):** `LLMService.stream()` exists in the provider interface. EventBus provides real-time event propagation. However, `StreamingService` is not yet wired into the execution engine, and SSE/WebSocket transports for external streaming are planned for v0.5.0 (A2A server SSE).

---

### 8. ✅ RESOLVED — MISSING TEST INFRASTRUCTURE — Severity: MEDIUM

> **Resolution (v0.1.0-v0.4.0):** Test provider (`withProvider("test")` + `withTestResponses()`) enables deterministic offline testing. 442 tests across 77 files. CI via GitHub Actions. Integration smoke tests cover builder combinations, tool pipelines, guardrails, error recovery, and memory. Eval framework with LLM-as-judge and EvalStore persistence. Benchmarks for e2e latency and template compilation.

---

### 9. ✅ RESOLVED — `this` BINDING BUG IN EFFECT.GEN — Severity: MEDIUM

> **Resolution (v0.1.0):** All services use `Context.Tag` + `Layer.effect` pattern (no classes, no `this`). Services are closures that capture dependencies via `yield*` from Effect context. The `effect-ts-patterns` skill explicitly prohibits OOP class patterns.

---

### 10. ✅ RESOLVED — ARCHITECTURE INCONSISTENCY: 9 vs 10 LAYERS — Severity: LOW

> **Resolution (v0.1.0):** All documentation consistently refers to 13 composable layers (core, llm-provider, memory, reasoning, tools, guardrails, verification, cost, identity, observability, interaction, orchestration, prompts). Architecture diagrams in README, docs site, and `architecture-reference` skill are consistent.

---

## STRATEGIC Weaknesses

### 11. 🔨 IN PROGRESS — MISSING A2A (Agent-to-Agent) PROTOCOL SUPPORT

> **Status (v0.5.0 Sprint 1):** New `@reactive-agents/a2a` package planned with JSON-RPC 2.0 server/client, Agent Cards, SSE streaming. See `spec/docs/14-v0.5-comprehensive-plan.md` Sprint 1 for full implementation plan.

**The Problem:**
The competitive analysis notes Pydantic AI has A2A support. Google's A2A protocol is becoming standardized alongside MCP (for tool integration, A2A is for agent-to-agent). Not supporting A2A misses an interoperability opportunity.

**Recommendation:** Add A2A support to Layer 7 (Orchestration) or Layer 8 (Tools). At minimum, note it in the architecture as a future addition.

---

### 12. ✅ MOSTLY RESOLVED — NO INPUT SANITIZATION / SANDBOXING

> **Status (v0.4.0):** GuardrailService provides injection detection, PII scanning, and toxicity filtering. ToolService has sandboxed execution with timeout enforcement and risk-level gates (low/medium/high/critical). Rate limiting for API calls remains a v0.8.0 target.

**Remaining:** Rate limiting per provider, circuit breakers — planned for v0.8.0 (Production Hardening).

---

### 13. ⚠️ PARTIALLY RESOLVED — NO GRACEFUL DEGRADATION

> **Status (v0.4.0):** Cost routing provides model tier selection (complexity-based). Budget enforcement stops before overspend. Memory uses bun:sqlite (not LanceDB — more resilient). Optional services via `Effect.serviceOption` gracefully degrade when layers aren't provided. Full circuit breakers and fallback model chains planned for v0.8.0.

**Remaining:** Fallback model chains, circuit breakers with configurable thresholds — planned for v0.8.0.

---

### 14. ✅ RESOLVED — TIMELINE RISK: PHASE 3 IS OVERLOADED

> **Resolution (v0.4.0):** All Phase 3 packages shipped (identity, orchestration, observability, prompts, interaction with 5 modes, CLI). No dashboard UI built (correctly descoped). Total build time was ~3 days (v0.1.0 through v0.4.0, Feb 20-22 2026) using agent-assisted development, far faster than the original 12-month estimate.

---

### 15. ✅ RESOLVED — EFFECT-TS LEARNING CURVE NOT ADDRESSED

> **Resolution (v0.1.0):** `effect-ts-patterns` skill created in `.claude/skills/` — covers the exact 20% of Effect API needed (Schema.Struct, Data.TaggedError, Context.Tag + Layer.effect, Ref, Effect.sync/tryPromise, Layer composition). `llm-api-contract` skill covers the most common API mistake patterns. `implement-service` skill provides step-by-step service creation templates. All three auto-load as context for AI agents.
