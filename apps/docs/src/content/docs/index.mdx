## Why Reactive Agents?

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Type-Safe Agents" icon="seti:typescript">
    Every agent, tool, and memory operation is fully typed with Effect-TS
    schemas. Catch errors at compile time, not in production.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Composable Layers" icon="puzzle">
    Mix and match capabilities — memory, reasoning, guardrails, cost tracking —
    using Effect's Layer system. Only pay for what you use.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Observable by Default" icon="magnifier">
    Built-in tracing, metrics, and structured logging. Every agent decision is
    inspectable through the 10-phase execution engine.
  </Card>
  <Card title="5 Interaction Modes" icon="setting">
    From fully autonomous to human-in-the-loop collaborative. Agents
    dynamically escalate and de-escalate based on confidence.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Quick Example

```typescript
import { ReactiveAgents } from "reactive-agents";

const agent = await ReactiveAgents.create()
  .withName("research-assistant")
  .withProvider("anthropic")
  .withModel("claude-sonnet-4-20250514")
  .withMemory("1")
  .withReasoning()
  .withGuardrails()
  .build();

const result = await agent.run("Summarize the key findings from this paper");
console.log(result.output);
```

## Architecture at a Glance

```
ReactiveAgentBuilder
  -> createRuntime()
    -> CoreServices (EventBus, AgentService, TaskService)
    -> LLMProvider  (Anthropic, OpenAI, Ollama)
    -> Memory       (Working, Semantic, Episodic, Procedural)
    -> Reasoning    (ReAct, Plan-Execute, Tree-of-Thought)
    -> Tools        (Registry, Sandbox, MCP)
    -> Guardrails   (Injection, PII, Toxicity, Contracts)
    -> Verification (Semantic Entropy, Fact Decomposition)
    -> Cost         (Complexity Router, Budget Enforcer)
    -> Interaction  (5 Modes, Checkpoints, Collaboration)
    -> ExecutionEngine (10-phase lifecycle with hooks)
```
